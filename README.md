# Here is a tutorial on how to use this github if you are new to github. 

Step 1: open vs code and open a empty c drive, d drive, whichever.
Step 2: In the terminal you're going to type in "git clone https://github.com/looksorn789/My-Daily-Journal.git"
Step 3: now you open vs code into the folder that has all the contents inside. and install react in the folder that has gitignore, not gitignore file itself. REALLY IMPORTANT. So it should look like E:/my_daily_journal
Step 4: Type npm install in the terminal after you are in the right folder. Now to start the website, you just type npm start
